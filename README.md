<br>

## About Project
<br>
Target: To build a fraud detection system using machine learning models
<br>
-  Logistic Regression<br>
-  Decision Tree<br>
-  Random Forest<br>
<br>

## Result
The balance accuracy of Decision Tree and Random Forest model are much higher than Logistic Regression. 
-> We will choose Decision Tree or Random Forest
